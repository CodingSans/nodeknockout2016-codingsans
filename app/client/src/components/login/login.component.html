  <h3> Project made for <a href="https://www.nodeknockout.com"> Node Knockout 2016 </a></h3>
  <p> We had 48 hours to create something using Node.JS <br>The project would have been a destructive message service,
  where you are able to create messages which are alive for a given time only. <br> After the time is over,
  the message is getting destroyed and there is no way to see it again. <br> We wanted to make it possible to control the service from Slack
  with custom commands. However, we had no time to finish. More information at the repository of the project!</p>
